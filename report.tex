\section*{Introduction}

Tetris is a single-player video game originally developed by computer engineer Alexey Pajitnov. The game is known to be NP-complete even when the input string of pieces is known in advance; however, attempts at creating automatic game players have been highly successful in the past, with the best agents able to clear millions of lines. In our project, we solve a simplified version of the game containing no gravity and the inability to "maneuver" the piece once it has been released.
